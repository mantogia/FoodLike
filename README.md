# FoodLike

The web application FoodLike - nutritional analysis inspired by the mobile dating app [Tinder](https://tinder.com/).  
A project by students of the ZHAW SML Winterthur.

## Backend remarks 

Please make sure that [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) is **installed** and **running**.  
Please replace the **username** and **password** for access permission to your personal MySQL database in the following file  
`ðŸ“‚ ./src/main/resources/application.properties`  
  
Create a new Schema in **MySQL** with the following name 

```sh
CREATE SCHEMA nutritionapp;
```
  
> **Note:** Please `Set as Default Schema`   

After the Schema has been created and you have selected `Set as Default Schema`: insert the necessary MySQL statements into the database.  
These statements can be found here `ðŸ“‚ ./src/main/resources/data.sql`

## Frontend Compilation

Open a terminal on `ðŸ“‚ ./svelte/` folder 
and launch `$ npm install` / `$ yarn`
to install dependencies

To launch frontend compilation in development mode:
`$ npm run java:dev` / `$ yarn java:dev`

To launch frontend compilation in production mode:
`$ npm run java` / `$ yarn java`

> **Note:** You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

## Run application

To start the application, you can either use the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension **[Spring Boot Dashboard](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-boot-dashboard)** *(Recommended)*  

**OR**  

you can start the project directly through your terminal with the command:
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```  

Now you should be able to access the application via `localhost:8082` with a browser of your choice.  

## Important remarks

We have installed the following Visual Studio Code **Extensions** in our development environment. 
Not all are necessary for the execution of the application, but we highly recommend that you install them as well, otherwise we cannot guarantee smooth functionality.
